        website (&quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its
        related products and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;). This
        Agreement is legally binding between you (&quot;User&quot;,
        &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and this Website operator
        (&quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or
        &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using the Website and Services, you
        acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the
        terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on
        behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have
        the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the
        terms &quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; shall refer
        to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not
        agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this
        Agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. You
        acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the
        Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by
        you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.

      <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
      <p>
        Although the Website and Services may link to other resources (such as
        websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or
        indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship,
        endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless
        specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or
        evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or
        individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any
        responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and
        content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the
        legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you
        access through a link on the Website and Services. Your linking to any
        other off-site resources is at your own risk.
      </p>
      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the
        Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
        suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect,
        incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages
        (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue,
        sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business
        interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity)
        however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
        limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty,
        negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to
        the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To
        the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability
        of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
        suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an
        amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you
        to the Operator for the prior one month period prior to the first event
        or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and
        exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for
        any losses or fails of its essential purpose.
      </p>
      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates,
        directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors harmless
        from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including
        reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with or arising from
        any third party allegations, claims, actions, disputes, or demands
        asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content,
        your use of the Website and Services or any willful misconduct on your
        part.
      </p>
      <h2>Severability</h2>
      <p>
        All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised
        and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not
        violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
        necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid
        or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this
        Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that
        the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their
        agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such
        remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
        effect.
      </p>
